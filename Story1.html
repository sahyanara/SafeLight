                    <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH3">You know Thomas Kent as Mr. Kent because he is your best friendâ€™s father. He picks you and your friend up from school every afternoon and offers for you to come over and hang out. Your mother often wants you home after school so you always turn down Mr. Kent. One day you ask your mom if she would allow you to hang out at your friend's house directly after school. You get to her house and Mr. Kent starts talking about all the work he has to do. You grow increasingly close with your best friend and Mr. Kent as you are now going over their house everyday after school. Mr. Kent decides to bring you and your friend on a work call with him. He begins asking you small favors in exchange for rewards. He begins to rely on you and uses you for chores and favors without permission. You grow increasingly close to his family and begin to trust them. You are now being exploited and taken advantage of without your realization because of the trust you have instilled in Mr. Kent.</h1>
