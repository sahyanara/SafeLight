                <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH2">What can you do to appear more confident?</h1>
                <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH4">Recently, our team talked to our local police force, the GTPD, about self defense methods that could be helpful this course. We were expecting the typical advice like carrying a whistle, knowing how to get out of simple holds, and things of that nature. We were surprised to hear them discuss the importance of self confidence instead. If you can appear confident to the predator in question, look them in the eye and show them you’re not afraid and walk with a purpose, then they are less likely to attempt to harm or harass you. This is valuable information for any youth when he or she is alone. However, since our goal is more focused on the long term grooming and trafficking process rather than the infrequent times of sex traffickees getting “plucked” off the street, we can apply this same concept to the long term. Yes, the appearance of self confidence can temporarily protect you from being a victim, and this tool should be utilized like any other. In the long term though, developing self confidence can aid youth in avoiding being targeted for grooming in the first place.</h1>
                <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH3B">Follow these tips:</h1>
                <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH3">1. Walk with a purpose</h1>
