                            <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH3B">Scenario #2 </h1>
                            <h1 class="ArchivoNarrowH4">You first encountered Jason when you swiped right on his Tinder profile because of his good looks and witty biography. You begin messaging him through the app and exchange social media profiles. You and Jason are growing to be virtual friends. One night you decide that it is time to meet him. Jason picks you up in his car and brings you to get fast food and hang out for a while. Jason offers you marijuana and the two of you begin to like each other. You now see Jason every other day and routinely smoke marijuana together. You trust Jason, you think you know him well, and you have a genuinely good feeling about your romantic relationship. Jason then tells you that he deals marijuana and has orders to fulfill. He tells you of his clients and that you must engage in sexual actions and drug runs with them or you will not be allowed to smoke his marijuana. You agree to work for him in this manner because you like him, trust him, and want to continue smoking marijuana with him. You have been taken advantage of and held to perform actions against your will because you felt that this person could never hurt you and deserved to be trusted.</h1>
