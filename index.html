            <h3 class="ArchivoNarrowH3">We are youth working to educate, protect, and equip fellow youth through SafeLight. By designing the interactive, educational website SafeLight,  teenagers and their parents/guardians are able to learn key information regarding sex trafficking that is often misunderstood.  Instead of simply creating an informational page designed to only inform, the quizzes, videos, and story lines offered throughout the interactive course make the experience more enjoyable and retainable for the public, while developing crucial skills in decision making. Our goal for this educational course is to disprove the misconceptions surrounding sex trafficking and empower youth to protect themselves and make well informed decisions, while simultaneously decreasing their own vulnerability.</h3>

I’ve always heard stories about sex trafficking, but after learning more about the subject it was shocking to see just how differently the media portrays this subject area from the actual truth. I’m excited to work with my peers on Safelight to develop an easy to use, and accessible tool that can really make an impact on sex trafficking prevention.</h1>
